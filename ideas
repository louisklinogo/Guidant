[] There is nothing like Guidant Evolution, only Guidant

[] I have an issue with how Tickets are generated

[] Instead of hardcoding models into codebase, cant we have a serperate filee we can define the models and then use them in the codebase? 

[]research config and make sure model names, provide info etc is correct

[]implementation phase, tass should follows solid principles

[] logging to be realtime and documentation

[] Audit Key files in src to make sure thy're solid etc

[] audit project types.js to make sure lidits so

[ lead magnet]
[]src config, check folder and make sure there are no inconsistencies

[] why are there fallback models hardcoded in my code

[ ] audit mcp tools.

[] provisio for logging in guidant system organized by current daet

[] project types.js

[] .Taskmaster dir covers everything for projects


🔥 Great thinking! You're right — **SOLID principles** mainly apply to **Phase 4: Implementation**. But each SDLC phase also has **its own “best practices” or guiding principles** that make your software stronger.

| 1. **Concept**              | **Design Thinking**, **First Principles Thinking** – Focus on *why*, user value, and vision         |
| 2. **Requirement Analysis** | **MoSCoW Prioritization**, **SMART Criteria**, **User Stories** – Define *what matters most*        |
| 3. **System Design**        | **DRY/KISS/YAGNI**, **Design Patterns**, **High Cohesion / Low Coupling** – Blueprint smart systems |
| 4. **Implementation**       | **SOLID Principles**, **Clean Code**, **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** – Write great code          |
| 5. **Testing & Deployment** | **CI/CD**, **Automated Testing**, **Shift Left Testing**, **DevOps** – Ship quality code safely     |

📋 Next Steps
Phase 2: Selective Ink integration for guidant live (real-time dashboard)
Phase 3: Enhanced features (task integration, reports, plugin system)


No, there's no auto-update system. The current approach is manual discovery only:

One-time discovery - discoverCapabilities() runs when project initializes
Static storage - Results saved to .taskmaster/ai/capabilities.json
No refresh mechanism - Registry doesn't update when tools change
Missing capabilities:

No tool change detection
No registry versioning or updates
No learning from successful tool usage patterns
No adaptation based on project needs
Should add:

Tool change detection on each session start
Registry update triggers when new tools discovered
Learning system that improves tool recommendations based on usage
Version tracking for capability evolution
This is a significant gap - the system could become outdated quickly as tools change.

Also I want to suggest that our own internal databse of tools be enriched from time to time so that Taskmasters own tool registly is current because many AI assisntant like copilot, cursor, replit etc might have different tools and if one uses Taskmaster with them, taskmaster should be able to update its own list becasue everyone has different cabilities, some may have similar capabilities under diff names and so on and so forth.



## Example Output

```yaml
ticket_id: AUTH-101
title: Implement Login Endpoint
type: Task
parent_story: Core Authentication Flows
parent_epic: User Authentication System
priority: High
complexity: Medium
estimated_points: 5
status: Ready for Implementation

description: |
  Create a RESTful API endpoint that authenticates users with email/password
  and returns a JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Endpoint accepts POST requests to /api/auth/login
  - Validates email format and password requirements
  - Returns 200 OK with JWT token for valid credentials
  - Returns 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials
  - Implements rate limiting (max 5 failed attempts per minute)
  - Logs authentication attempts (success/failure) without passwords
  - Response time under 300ms for 95% of requests

technical_specifications:
  - Use Express.js router for endpoint definition
  - Implement bcrypt for password comparison
  - Generate JWT with 15-minute expiration and refresh token
  - Include user ID and roles in JWT payload
  - Store refresh token in database with user association
  - Implement express-rate-limit middleware for rate limiting

dependencies:
  - User model with password field
  - JWT configuration service
  - Authentication middleware

implementation_guide: |
  1. Create route in src/routes/auth.js
  2. Implement validation using Joi or similar
  3. Add rate limiting middleware
  4. Implement password comparison logic
  5. Generate and return JWT token
  6. Add logging (ensure no sensitive data is logged)
  7. Write unit and integration tests

code_examples:
  - language: javascript
    description: "Route definition"
    code: |
      router.post('/login', validateLogin, rateLimiter, async (req, res) => {
        try {
          const { email, password } = req.body;
          const user = await User.findOne({ email });

          if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password))) {
            logger.warn(`Failed login attempt for email: ${email}`);
            return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
          }

          const token = generateJWT(user);
          const refreshToken = await generateRefreshToken(user);

          logger.info(`Successful login for user: ${user.id}`);
          return res.json({ token, refreshToken });
        } catch (error) {
          logger.error(`Login error: ${error.message}`);
          return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
        }
      });

testing_requirements:
  - Unit test for validation logic
  - Unit test for token generation
  - Integration test for successful login
  - Integration test for invalid credentials
  - Integration test for rate limiting
  - Performance test for response time
