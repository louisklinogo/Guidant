# TaskMaster Evolution - Realistic Development Roadmap

> **Mission**: Make AI coding agents systematic and professional by orchestrating proper SDLC workflows while maintaining context and presenting only business decisions to users.

---

## üéØ **CORE PROBLEMS WE SOLVE**

TaskMaster addresses fundamental AI agent limitations:
- **Context Loss**: AI agents forget previous work between sessions
- **No Systematic Process**: Jump to coding without research/planning
- **Poor Research**: Don't use available tools (Tavily, Context7) effectively  
- **Technical Overwhelm**: Present complex technical details to business users
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Skip testing, documentation, and best practices

- [ ] **Milestone Tracking** - Clear progress markers and deliverables

---

## üîß **PHASE 4: SCALE AND POLISH**
*Support multiple projects and advanced workflows*

### **Multi-Project Support**
- [ ] **Project Isolation** - Separate contexts for different projects
- [ ] **Template System** - Reusable project templates and patterns
- [ ] **Cross-Project Learning** - Apply lessons across projects
- [ ] **Portfolio Management** - Handle multiple active projects

### **Advanced Orchestration**
- [ ] **Parallel Development** - Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
- [ ] **Dependency Management** - Handle complex task relationships
- [ ] **Custom Workflows** - Domain-specific development processes
- [ ] **Integration Points** - Connect with external tools and services

### **Community Features**
- [ ] **Template Sharing** - Community-contributed project templates
- [ ] **Best Practices** - Documented patterns and workflows
- [ ] **Success Stories** - Real-world usage examples
- [ ] **Feedback System** - Continuous improvement based on user input

- Basic demo projects work end-to-end

### **Phase 2 Success**
- AI agents follow systematic workflows consistently
- Business users can make decisions without technical knowledge
- Projects complete with professional quality output
- Context is preserved throughout development lifecycle

### **Phase 3 Success**
- Smooth user experience for non-technical users
- Predictable project timelines and outcomes
- Clear value demonstration through case studies
- Growing community of users and contributors

### **Phase 4 Success**
- Support for complex, multi-month projects
- Template ecosystem for common project types
- Proven track record of successful deployments
- Established patterns for systematic AI development

## üéØ **WHAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING**

### **Avoid These Temptations**
- ‚ùå "One-command app generation" - Not realistic or valuable
- ‚ùå Visual design tools - AI agents work with text, not graphics
- ‚ùå Enterprise platform features - Focus on core workflow orchestration
- ‚ùå Cutting-edge AI research - Use existing tools effectively
- ‚ùå Universal deployment platform - Too complex, use existing solutions

### **Stay Focused On**
- ‚úÖ Making AI agents systematic and consistent
- ‚úÖ Maintaining context across long development cycles
- ‚úÖ Presenting business decisions clearly to non-technical users
- ‚úÖ Enforcing proper research and planning phases
- ‚úÖ Ensuring professional quality output

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**

### **Week 1-2: Critical Assessment**
1. **Audit Current MCP Tools** - Test every tool, document failures
2. **Fix Breaking Issues** - Get basic functionality working
3. **Document Setup Process** - Clear installation and configuration guide
4. **Create Simple Demo** - End-to-end project example

### **Week 3-4: Core Reliability**
1. **Improve Error Handling** - Graceful failures everywhere
2. **Enhance File Management** - Robust `.taskmaster/` operations
3. **Test with Real Projects** - Use TaskMaster for actual development
4. **Gather User Feedback** - What works, what doesn't

### **Month 2-3: Workflow Polish**
1. **Refine Phase Transitions** - Smooth handoffs between development phases
2. **Improve Business Interface** - Hide technical complexity better
3. **Add Quality Gates** - Ensure proper validation at each step
4. **Create Project Templates** - Common patterns for different project types

---

## üí° **CORE INSIGHT**

TaskMaster's value is **not** in replacing developers or magically generating apps. Its value is in making AI agents **systematic, consistent, and business-focused** instead of chaotic and overwhelming.

**The Goal**: Transform AI coding agents from talented but unpredictable assistants into disciplined, professional development partners that follow proper SDLC processes.

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Next Review**: Weekly during Phase 1, Monthly thereafter  
**Focus**: Systematic AI agent workflows, not fantasy features
