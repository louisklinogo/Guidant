# TaskMaster Evolution PRD: AI Agent Workflow Framework

<context>
# Overview  
TaskMaster Evolution transforms AI assistants like Claude from chaotic, inconsistent coders into systematic, professional developers through structured workflow orchestration. It provides a framework of templates, file organization, and task tickets that guide AI agents through complete Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) processes.

**Problem Solved:** AI assistants suffer from context loss, lack of systematic processes, poor research practices, inconsistent execution, communication gaps, and decision-making paralysis. They can code well but lack the project management discipline to deliver complete, professional software solutions.

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) that need systematic guidance and workflow structure
- **Secondary:** Non-technical entrepreneurs and business users with software ideas who interact through AI assistants
- **Tertiary:** Solo developers seeking structured AI-assisted development workflows

**Value Proposition:** "Transform any AI assistant into a systematic software development partner" - providing the workflow structure and guidance that enables AI agents to deliver complete, professional applications from vague ideas to deployment.

# Core Features  

## 1. AI Assistant Workflow Framework
**What it does:** Provides structured workflow templates, detailed task tickets, and role-specific guidance that transform any AI assistant into a systematic developer through clear instructions and expectations.

**Why it's important:** AI assistants are powerful but lack project management discipline. This framework provides the structure they need to work systematically rather than chaotically.

**How it works:** TaskMaster discovers AI assistant capabilities, generates detailed task tickets with step-by-step instructions, maintains project state in organized file structure, and guides AI through role-based workflows (Research Agent → Design Agent → Development Agent phases).

## 2. Systematic SDLC Workflow Templates
**What it does:** Provides structured templates for six development phases (Concept → Requirements → Design → Architecture → Implementation → Deployment) with detailed task breakdowns and quality checkpoints.

**Why it's important:** Prevents AI assistants from jumping to coding without proper planning, ensures no critical steps are skipped, maintains professional development standards through systematic guidance.

**How it works:** TaskMaster loads phase-appropriate task templates, provides detailed instructions for each step, and uses review status gates to ensure quality before phase advancement. AI assistant reports progress and TaskMaster provides next appropriate task.

## 3. Shared Memory and Context Management
**What it does:** Maintains complete project state, decision history, and progress tracking through organized file system that both AI assistant and user can access and update.

**Why it's important:** Solves AI session amnesia by providing persistent memory that survives conversation restarts, role switches, and extended development timelines.

**How it works:** AI assistant logs all work, decisions, and progress into structured `.taskmaster/` directory. TaskMaster reads this state to provide appropriate next tasks and context. System maintains history across multiple sessions and role changes.

## 4. AI Capability Discovery and Tool Integration
**What it does:** Discovers what tools each AI assistant has available, maps capabilities to tasks, and provides detailed instructions for using specific tools effectively.

**Why it's important:** Ensures TaskMaster only assigns tasks that AI assistant can actually complete with available tools, and provides step-by-step guidance for tool usage.

**How it works:** Initial capability exchange where AI assistant reports available tools (web_search, Tavily, create_file, etc.). TaskMaster matches tasks to capabilities and provides detailed tool usage instructions. If required tools missing, guides user to configure them.

## 5. Quality Assurance Through Review Gates
**What it does:** Implements systematic quality checkpoints using review status that requires validation before advancing to next phase or task.

**Why it's important:** Prevents AI assistant from rushing through tasks without proper validation, catches issues early, ensures professional-quality output.

**How it works:** AI assistant sets tasks to "review" status when complete. TaskMaster (or user) validates work quality before allowing progression. Review gates catch issues like missing research, incomplete implementation, or poor quality code before moving forward.

## 6. Business Decision Abstraction Layer
**What it does:** Guides AI assistant to translate complex technical decisions into simple business choices that non-technical users can understand and approve.

**Why it's important:** Enables non-technical users to maintain control over project direction while AI assistant handles technical complexity behind the scenes.

**How it works:** TaskMaster provides templates for presenting technical options in business terms (cost, timeline, features). AI assistant performs technical analysis, then presents simplified choices to user for approval before proceeding.
